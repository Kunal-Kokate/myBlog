# AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to machines or software that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. It can be categorized into different types:

## ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)

Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) is designed to perform a specific task or a narrow range of tasks. These systems are highly specialized and cannot perform functions outside of their programmed capabilities.

**Examples:**
- Smart speakers (like Amazon Alexa or Google Home)
- Self-driving cars
- Web search engines
- AI used in farming (e.g., crop monitoring, automated harvesting)
- AI in factories (e.g., robotic arms, quality control systems)

## Generative AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence)

Generative AI refers to AI systems that can create new content such as text, images, audio, or code. These models learn patterns from large amounts of data and use that to generate original outputs.

**Examples:**
- ChatGPT (for generating text or answering questions)
- Bard (Google’s conversational AI)
- Midjourney (for creating images)
- DALL·E (for generating images from text descriptions)

## AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) describes a hypothetical form of AI that would be capable of understanding, learning, and performing any intellectual task that a human can do. AGI does not exist yet but is a major goal in AI research.

**Key point:**
- AGI would have the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, and learn across a wide range of tasks, just like humans.


# Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns to map an input (A) to an output (B). You train the model on a dataset that includes both inputs and their corresponding correct outputs.

**Concept:**  
A --> B    
Input --> Output  


### Examples

| **Input (A)**       | **Output (B)**            | **Application**          |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| email               | spam (0/1)               | spam filtering          |
| audio               | text transcripts         | speech recognition      |
| English             | Spanish                   | machine translation     |
| ad, user info       | click (0/1)             | online advertising     |
| image, radar info   | position of other cars   | self-driving cars      |
| image of phone      | defect (0/1)            | visual inspection     |
| sequence of words   | next word               | chatbot                |

**Key points:**
- The "0/1" indicates a binary decision (e.g., spam or not spam, defect or no defect).
- The model learns from labeled examples (datasets where the correct answer is provided) to predict outputs on new, unseen data.
